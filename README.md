# BIS15W2021_jviswanathan

# Hello and welcome! My name is Jayashri Viswanathan. I am currently a senior at UC Davis studying Biochemistry. This is my repository for BIS 15 - data science for biologists. I'm hoping to use the skills learned in this class for my future research projects in graduate school. Furthermore, I'm hoping this course can serve as a springboard to learn more programming and data science. 

## May peace prevail on Earth!!
