## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv(here("lab10", "data", "surveys_complete.csv"))
```

```
## 
## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## cols(
##   record_id = col_double(),
##   month = col_double(),
##   day = col_double(),
##   year = col_double(),
##   plot_id = col_double(),
##   species_id = col_character(),
##   sex = col_character(),
##   hindfoot_length = col_double(),
##   weight = col_double(),
##   genus = col_character(),
##   species = col_character(),
##   taxa = col_character(),
##   plot_type = col_character()
## )
```

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?

```r
deserts %>%
  summarise(number_genera = n_distinct(genus),
            number_species = n_distinct(species),
            n=n()) 
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   number_genera number_species     n
##           <int>          <int> <int>
## 1            26             40 34786
```

```r
#there are 26 distinct genera and 40 distinct species. there are 34786 observations.

deserts %>%
  select(genus, species) %>%
  group_by(genus, species) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'genus'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

```
## # A tibble: 48 x 3
## # Groups:   genus [26]
##    genus           species          n
##    <chr>           <chr>        <int>
##  1 Dipodomys       merriami     10596
##  2 Chaetodipus     penicillatus  3123
##  3 Dipodomys       ordii         3027
##  4 Chaetodipus     baileyi       2891
##  5 Reithrodontomys megalotis     2609
##  6 Dipodomys       spectabilis   2504
##  7 Onychomys       torridus      2249
##  8 Perognathus     flavus        1597
##  9 Peromyscus      eremicus      1299
## 10 Neotoma         albigula      1252
## # ... with 38 more rows
```

```r
#Dipodomys merriami is the most frequently samples species in this study. 
```

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.

```r
#this is the table.
deserts_proportion <- deserts %>%
  count(taxa) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(proportion_taxa = n / total) %>%
  arrange(desc(proportion_taxa))

deserts_proportion
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
##   taxa        n total proportion_taxa
##   <chr>   <int> <int>           <dbl>
## 1 Rodent  34247 34786        0.985   
## 2 Bird      450 34786        0.0129  
## 3 Rabbit     75 34786        0.00216 
## 4 Reptile    14 34786        0.000402
```

```r
#this is the plot. 
deserts_proportion %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = taxa, y = proportion_taxa))+
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Proportion of each Taxon in Deserts Data",
       x = "Taxon",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = taxa, fill = plot_type))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Individuals Sampled by Plot Type",
       x = "Taxon",
       y = "# of Observations") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = (0.5)))
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->


5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(weight != "NA") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = weight))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Weight Ranges Organized by Species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Weight") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->


6. Add another layer to your answer from #4 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(weight != "NA") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = weight))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5 , color = "blue", position = "jitter") +
  labs(title = "Weight Ranges Organized by Species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Weight") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->


7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?


```r
DM_year <- deserts %>%
  select(genus, species, year) %>%
  unite("genus_species", genus, species, sep = "_") %>%
  filter(genus_species == "Dipodomys_merriami") %>%
  group_by(genus_species, year) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  arrange(year)
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'genus_species'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

```r
DM_year %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
#over time, the # of observations of DM fluctuates.
```


8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))+
  geom_point()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](lab10_hw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
#there seems to be a positive correlation between weight and hindfoot length.
```


9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(weight != "NA") %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  summarise(average_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_weight)) #NL and DS have the highest average weight. 
```

```
## # A tibble: 25 x 2
##    species_id average_weight
##    <chr>               <dbl>
##  1 NL                  159. 
##  2 DS                  120.

```


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(weight != "NA" ,
         hindfoot_length != "NA") %>%
  group_by(species_id) %>%
  mutate(weight_hindfoot_ratio = weight / hindfoot_length)
```

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.


```r
deserts %>%
  select(species, weight, sex) %>%
  filter(weight != "NA", sex != "NA") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = weight, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Weights Across Species: Male versus Female",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Weight") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```
